Feature: Monitor Jetstream Allocation Sources
  Monitoring the TACC API for Jetstream allocation sources

  Background: Some TAS API fixtures
    Given a TAS API driver
    And a current time of '2017-02-15T05:00:00Z'

      | user108  |
      | user109  |
      | user110  |
      | user111  |
    And the following XSEDE to TACC username mappings
    # Note: No tacc_username for `user107`
      | xsede_username | tacc_username |
      | user108        | tacc_user108  |

  Scenario: Calculate allocation source snapshots
    When we get all projects
    And we fill user allocation sources from TAS
    And we update snapshots
    Then we should have the following allocation source snapshots
