Feature: Launching & editing of an instance

  Background:
    Given a dummy browser
    And a current time of '2017-02-15T05:00:00Z' with tick = False
    And "Admin" as the persona
    When I set "username" to "admin"
    And I set "password" to "very-clever-admin-password"
    And we create a new admin user
    And we create a provider "MockProvider"
    And we create an identity for the current persona on provider "MockProvider"
    And we make the current identity the admin on provider "MockProvider"

  Scenario: Launch instance and assign allocation source
    Given "user407" as the persona
    When I set "username" to "user407"
    And I set "password" to "some-very-long-string"
    And we create a new user
    Given a current time of '2017-02-16T06:00:00Z' with tick = False
    When I log in
    And we create an account for the current persona on provider "MockProvider"
    And we ensure that the user has an allocation source
    Then I should have the following quota on provider "MockProvider"
      | key               | value |
      | cpu               | 16    |

    And we should have the following user allocation sources
      | atmosphere_username | allocation_source |
      | user407             | user407           |
    When we update CyVerse snapshots
    Then we should have the following allocation source snapshots

    And we should have the following user allocation source snapshots
