Feature: Enforcing allocation usage on Jetstream
  - Prevent launching of an instance if not enough allocation
  - Send emails at various thresholds
  - Shelve instances when last threshold
  - Allow launching instances after allocation is reset/renewed (manually? Or trigger event?)

  Scenario: Test basic enforcing
    Given "Admin" as the persona
    When I set "username" to "admin"
    And I set "password" to "very-clever-admin-password"
    And we create a new admin user
    And we create a provider "MockProvider"
    And we create an identity for the current persona on provider "MockProvider"
    And we make the current identity the admin on provider "MockProvider"

    Given "user208" as the persona
    When I set "username" to "user208"
