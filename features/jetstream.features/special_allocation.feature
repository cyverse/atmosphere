Feature: Special Allocations
  Test special (_sub_) allocations

  Background: Some TAS API fixtures
    Given a dummy browser
    And a TAS API driver
    And a current time of '2017-02-15T05:00:00Z'
    And we clear the local cache
    And the following Atmosphere users
    # Note: Not many Atmosphere users yet - will be created later
      | username |
      | user107  |
#      | user108  |
#      | user109  |
#      | user110  |
#      | user111  |
    And the following XSEDE to TACC username mappings
    # Note: No tacc_username for `user107`, but there is one for `user110`
      | xsede_username | tacc_username |

  Scenario: When a user logs in for the first time, and they only have access to the special allocation (`user110`)
    Given "Admin" as the persona
    When I set "username" to "admin"
    And I set "password" to "very-clever-admin-password"
    And we create a new admin user
    And we create a provider "MockProvider"
    And we create an identity for the current persona on provider "MockProvider"
    And we make the current identity the admin on provider "MockProvider"

    Given "user110" as the persona
    When I set "username" to "user110"
    And I set "password" to "some-very-long-string"

    Given a current time of '2017-02-16T05:00:00Z'
    When I log in with valid XSEDE project required and default quota plugin enabled
    And we create an account for the current persona on provider "MockProvider"
    Then I should have the following quota on provider "MockProvider"
      | key               | value |
      | cpu               | 2     |

      | atmosphere_username | allocation_source |
      | user110             | TG-ASC160018      |

    When we update snapshots
    Then we should have the following allocation source snapshots
      | name         | compute_used |
